          <p>
            Drawn together by their mutual love for Mediterranean cuisine and
            dedication to sustainable sourcing,{" "}
            <span>Carmen "Carmy" Berzatto</span> and <span>Sydney Adamu</span>{" "}
            embarked on a culinary adventure that would soon captivate the city.
          </p>
          {/* <p>
            Inspired by their respective backgrounds — Carmy's roots in Greek
            and Italian traditions, and Sydney's upbringing surrounded by the
            vibrant flavors of North Africa — the duo envisioned a restaurant
            that would celebrate the diverse tapestry of Mediterranean flavors
            while embracing modern culinary techniques.
          </p> */}

          <p>
            With Carmy's expertise in traditional recipes and Sydney's
            innovative approach to flavor pairings and presentation, Little
            Lemon was born. Together, they poured their hearts and souls into
            creating a dining experience that would transport guests to the
            sun-drenched shores of the Mediterranean, right here in Chicago.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their dedication to quality, community, and creativity quickly
            garnered attention, and Little Lemon soon became a beloved fixture
            in the city's culinary landscape. Today, their legacy lives on as
            Little Lemon continues to delight diners with its tantalizing
            dishes, warm hospitality, and commitment to excellence.
